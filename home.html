                Look at <em>IMPACT</em>. It looks so familiar, right? 
            <br>Maybe you have seen it somewhere else before? 
            <br>Definitely! It is called &quot;the meme font&quot; and has gone viral on social media! 
            <br>It always shows up within image macros. People use it to mock on EVERYTHING! 
            <br>Sounds like it is a clown font? Not really.
