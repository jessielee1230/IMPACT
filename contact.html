                <h1>THE IMPACT ZONE</h1>
                <p>Hi, I am Jessie Lee, the author of the website. Nice to meet you!</p>
                <p>IMPACT is a very interesting font. I have used it many times to create different memes on the social media even though I did not know it is called &quot;IMPACT&quot; until I picked it up as the topic font for my first assignment of 2016
                    Web and Time-based design. The font for the content is Georgia &#45; the ever elegant and neat font that I always use for narration. </p>
                <p>It is a pleasure that I can create the <em>IMPACT ZONE</em> website for creative designers like you to have more ideas about this web safe font! Hope you enjoy exploring here! Thank you for your visit!</p>
                <p>If you have any questions, don&#39;t hesitate to contact me:

                    <p>I am an exchange student from China. It is my first time to be in Australia and learn web-design. Although it is a little bit hard at the very beginning - learning coding in English as the second language, I make it with the help and
                        encouragement of the kindest tutor and lovely classmates! Thank you all! I really have a good time here. If you are also interested in web-design, photography or travelling, feel free to befriend me on Facebook!</p>
