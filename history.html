   <h1>The History of IMPACT font</h1>

   <p>In 1965, Geoffrey Lee designed a typeface that followed the 60s&#39; fashion of condensed, bold, sans-serif forms. The typeface was Impact and, as most brief descriptions of the typeface note, that is exactly what the face offers to text. Used mostly for headlines and display, it is designed to attract attention through the sheer power of its weight. </P>
    <p>However, Impact has led a more complex life than its eponymous quality suggests. Its existence has spanned several 20th-century printing technologies, it is one of the standard typefaces bundled in major operating systems, it was one of the 11 original core fonts for the web, and today it is the typeface used in most image macros.
    <p>One Downloaded from vcu.sagepub.com by guest on August 18, 2016 308 journal of visual culture can look at the story of Impact and see repetition and standardization, the thoughtless ease of employing programmed defaults. But one can also look at Impact, a cultural replicator, and see variation and creativity spurred on by the constructive pressure of constraints. It is Impact&#39;s longevity, and the coexistence of these two characteristics  &#45;  repetition and variation  &#45; that makes it a valuable subject through which to consider memes on the internet and memes in the original, general sense as cultural replicators. </P>
    <p>Impact&#39;s material or technological birth was somewhat anachronistic. It began as a metal typeface at a time when metal typecasting was on the decline, quickly being replaced by phototypesetting processes and by nascent digital methods. But while the technological identity of Impact might have been out of step with its wider time period, metal casting was the norm at the type foundry where it was designed. Lee, then the type director at Pembertons in London, designed Impact for Stephenson-Blake, a foundry in Sheffield that continued to produce metal type well into the 1990s, long after most print industries had shifted to phototypesetting and digital printing (Firth, 2008; Millington, 2002). Impact did not make an immediate splash, as other typefaces have. Rather, the story of its popular use began almost 30 years after its design. It was not until the introduction of desktop computers that Impact came to be a commonly used face. Typographically speaking, the early days of personal computing introduced a paradoxical expansion and limitation of diversity in design.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, the affordability and accessibility of design software invited new practitioners of typography. This was not a full &#39;democratization&#39; of design, but certainly an expansion of access to design tools. In addition, the negligible cost of producing digital type meant that aesthetic experimentation in design was now less of a financial risk. Strictly angular and bitmap typefaces, as well as type with programmed random forms emerged from this period through the innovation of a new cast of independent type foundries. </P>
    <p>On the other hand, the practical and technological limitations of early PCs and monitors led to strict limits on the amount of detail that could be encoded in digital typefaces or displayed onscreen. In 1992, into this liberating and yet restrictive climate, Microsoft introduced a digital version of Impact into its Windows operating system. This placed Impact in a diverse line-up of fonts that included the workhorse Times New Roman, the typewriter-style slab serif Courier, and two bespoke digital designs by the typographer Matthew Carter: Georgia and Verdana. <p>
    <p>By the mid-90s, Windows was the world&#39;s most common OS, and Internet Explorer the most common browser â€“ a level of dominance so aggressively pursued that it would become the central point in a federal anti-trust case against Microsoft. Consequently, the Windows kit of typefaces could be found on most of the world&#39;s PCs during the rise of the internet and the dotcom bubble. So in 1996, when the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) named a list of core fonts that were recommended for web design, many of the Windows fonts &#45; including Impact &#45;  were chosen for the purely pragmatic reason of mass compatibility.<p>

    <p><i>&quot;I believe the first time the font face changed to Impact was when somebody posted an image of a very obese black woman wearing a spandex superhero outfit, and the text just said <em>&#39;DAAAAMN.&#39;</em> After that, everybody seemed to use Impact.&quot;</i></p>
